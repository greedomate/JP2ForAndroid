# Build Configuration Fixes

## Changes Made to Fix JitPack Build Issues

**Date**: $(date)

### Issue 1: Signing Configuration Error
**File**: `testapp/build.gradle`
**Problem**: Reference to undefined `defaultKeyStoreFile` variable causing build failures in JitPack environment
**Solution**: Removed signingConfigs block and fixed malformed buildTypes structure

### Issue 2: Test App Inclusion in Build
**File**: `settings.gradle` 
**Problem**: Including testapp in settings caused JitPack to attempt building app with signing configs
**Solution**: Commented out testapp inclusion: `// include ':testapp'`

### Verification
**File**: `library/build.gradle`
**Status**: Maven publishing configuration already present and properly configured

## Rationale
These changes enable successful JitPack builds by:
1. Removing build-breaking signing configuration references
2. Excluding non-library modules from production builds
3. Maintaining existing maven publishing for library distribution

No functional code changes were made - only build configuration adjustments.

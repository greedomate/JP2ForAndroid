# Build Configuration Fixes

## Changes Made to Fix JitPack Build Issues

**Date**: $(date)

### Issue 1: Signing Configuration Error
**File**: `testapp/build.gradle`
**Problem**: Reference to undefined `defaultKeyStoreFile` variable causing build failures in JitPack environment
**Solution**: Removed signingConfigs block and fixed malformed buildTypes structure

### Issue 2: Test App Inclusion in Build
**File**: `settings.gradle` 
**Problem**: Including testapp in settings caused JitPack to attempt building app with signing configs
**Solution**: Commented out testapp inclusion: `// include ':testapp'`

### Verification
**File**: `library/build.gradle`
**Status**: Maven publishing configuration already present and properly configured

## Issue 3: Bintray Plugin Dependency Error (Critical)
**File**: `build.gradle` (root project)
**Problem**: Dependency on discontinued Bintray plugin causing JitPack build failures
**Solution**: Remove Bintray plugin dependency and replace jcenter() repositories with mavenCentral()

**Changes Made**:
- Line 12: Commented out `classpath 'com.jfrog.bintray.gradle:gradle-bintray-plugin:1.7.3'`
- Line 7: Replaced `jcenter()` with `mavenCentral()` in buildscript repositories
- Line 22: Replaced `jcenter()` with `mavenCentral()` in allprojects repositories

## Rationale
These changes enable successful JitPack builds by:
1. Removing build-breaking signing configuration references
2. Excluding non-library modules from production builds
3. Maintaining existing maven publishing for library distribution
4. Removing dependencies on discontinued services (JCenter/Bintray)

No functional code changes were made - only build configuration adjustments to support modern build systems.
